Creating Your Script
1. Introduce Yourself! 
Probably the easiest yet very effective way to make a welcoming impression is to start off with a quick self introduction at the beginning of your video. Simply talk about yourself like you’re talking to someone you just met. Also, don’t forget to mention your name and one fun fact about yourself.
2. Provide a Bit of History 
Let us know a bit more about you and what you have done to get to where are. What university did you go to? What did you study? What past professional or personal experiences do you have?
3. Find a Focus 
Once we get a feel of your past, jump right in and let us know why you joined Andela:
* Why Andela? 
* What were you doing before Andela, and what was your level of software development experience when you joined?  
* (If you have experience working with partners already, what have you done with them, and what was the experience like?  
* What do you hope to accomplish over the next couple years? 
* What are your long term career goals? 
4. End With a Punch 
End with a conclusion that leaves an impression on your viewers.
